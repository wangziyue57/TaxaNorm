# TaxNorm
TaxNorm is the R package for a novel feature-wise normalization method for microbiome data based on zero-inflated negative binomial model. This method assumes that the effects of sequencing depth vary for each taxon on their mean and incorporates a rational link of zero probability and taxon dispersion as a function of sequencing depth to better capture the microbiome data nature.
